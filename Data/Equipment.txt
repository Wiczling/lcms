Software:
The Agilent MassHunter Profinder was used to find all the matches per formula using “Batch Targeted Feature Extraction“ (containing 300 predefined mases for each analyte included in the mixture). Match tolerance of +/-20.00 ppm was assumed with the settings [Positive Ions > Charge carriers > +K > false; Positive Ions > Charge carriers > +NH4 > true].
